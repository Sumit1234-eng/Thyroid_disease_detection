# Thyroid-Detection
Thyroid disease is a very common problem in India, more than one crore people are suffering with the disease every year. Thyroid disorder can speed up or slow down the metabolism of the body.

The main objective of this project is to predict if a person is having thyroid or negative (no thyroid) with the help of Machine Learning. Classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression have been trained on the thyroid dataset, UCI Machine Learning repository. After hyperparameter tuning using randomized searchcv model has performed well with better accuracy, precision and recall. Application has deployed on pycharm with the help of flask framework

# Problem Statement
To build a classification methodology to predict the type of Thyroid based on the given training data.
# Data Pre-processing
Missing values handling 
Categorical features handling by label encoding
Feature scaling done by Standard Scalar method
Imbalanced dataset handled by SMOTE
Drop unnecessary columns

# Model Creation and Evaluation
Various classification algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression tested.
Random Forest were all performed well. Random Forest classifier was chosen for the final model training and testing.
Hyper parameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV
Model performance evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.
